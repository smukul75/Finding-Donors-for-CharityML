# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML - Supervised Learning
Did analysis of the factors that can affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on the real census data. Started with a naive classifier to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.

## Project Overview

* In this project, you will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. 
* You will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. 
    - identify features and target (label)
    - Feature exploration: column types (continuous/category), numeric/alphnumeric, list out each feature
    - check totals, counts, group by
    - distinct values in each column to know lowest/highest values
* Next, you will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. 
    - Logarithmic transformation for skewed continuous features
    - Normalizing numerical features (scaling: MinMax Scalar)
    - Encoding (One-Hot Encoder)
    - Shuffle and split
* You will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. 
* Afterwards, you will optimize the model you've selected and present it as your solution to CharityML. 
* Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
